Connecting Two in Cisco Packet Tracer 

#Add Devices:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

From the device toolbar, select and drag two Generic PCs into the workspace.

Connect the PCs:

Select the Connections tool (lightning bolt icon).
Choose the Copper Straight-Through cable.
Click on the first PC, select the FastEthernet0 interface.
Click on the second PC, select the FastEthernet0 interface.
This creates a direct physical link between the two PCs.

#Configuring IP Addresses
Each PC requires an IP address and subnet mask to communicate.

--Method 1: Using the PC GUI
Click on a PC.
Go to the Desktop tab.
Open the IP Configuration tool.
Set the IP Address (e.g., 192.168.1.1 for PC1 and 192.168.1.2 for PC2).
Set the Subnet Mask (typically 255.255.255.0).
Leave the default gateway empty for direct connection.

--Method 2: Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
Click on the PC.
Go to the Desktop tab.

Open the Command Prompt.
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew

Real-Time vs Simulation
--Real-Time Mode
Description: Real-Time mode reflects actual packet forwarding and device behavior in real time.
Usage: Use this mode to test network setups as they would operate in a live environment.
Behavior: All devices send and receive packets instantly as configured.

--Simulation Mode
Description: Simulation mode allows you to observe the flow of packets step-by-step.
Usage: Useful for educational purposes and troubleshooting to watch how packets travel through the network.
Behavior: Packets are queued and can be examined at each device hop before moving forward.

--Sending a Message Between PCs
In Real-Time Mode, select one PC.

Go to the Desktop tab.
Open the Command Prompt.
Use the ping command to test connectivity, e.g.:
ping 192.168.1.2
Alternatively, use the IP Configuration and Command Prompt tools on both PCs to send messages.

Observe the success or failure of message delivery.
